# Week 1 Quiz - Introduction to deep learning
<br>1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?

<br> A. AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.
<br> B. Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.
<br> C. AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.
<br> D. Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.
<br>
Answer: D
<br>
<br>
2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the two options that apply.)
<br> A. We have access to a lot more computational power.
<br> B. Neural Networks are a brand new field.
<br> C. We have access to a lot more data.
<br> D. Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
<br>
Answer: A,C,D
<br>
<br>
3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)
<br>
 <br> A. Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
 <br> B. Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
 <br> C. It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset.
 <br> D. Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).
<br>
Answer: A,B,D
<br>
<br>
4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
<br>
Answer: False
<br>
<br>

<br>
6. Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?
<br>
Answer: False
<br>
<br>
7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
<br>
Answer: False
<br>
<br>
8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)
<br>
<br> A.It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
<br> B.It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
<br> C.It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).
<br> D.RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....
<br>
Answer: A,C
<br>
<br>
9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?
<br>
<br> x-axis is the amount of data
<br> y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.
<br>
<br>
10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)
<br>
 <br> A. Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
 <br> B. Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
 <br> C. Decreasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
 <br> D. Decreasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
<br> Answer: A, B
<br>
